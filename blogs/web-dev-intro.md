# Introduction to Web Development

Date: [Publication Date]

Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites. It's a field that encompasses everything from simple static web pages to complex web applications, e-commerce sites, and social network services.

## The Three Core Technologies

### HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

HTML is the backbone of any website. It provides the structure and content of web pages.

Example:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

CSS is used to style and layout web pages â€” for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content.

Example:
```css
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
}

h1 {
    color: #333;
}
```

### JavaScript

JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages, making them interactive and dynamic.

Example:
```javascript
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello, World!";
```

## Conclusion

Web development is a vast and exciting field with endless possibilities. As you delve deeper, you'll encounter more advanced concepts like responsive design, server-side programming, databases, and much more.
